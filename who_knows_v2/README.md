Ok. So what will the basic functionality be for this app?

# Core Functionality
1. user can (and probably should only be able to) log in with Slack 
2. after logging in user has a profile page
3. user can list and maintain their skills on their profile page.
4. user can find other users based on their skill listings 
5. user can rate other users
6. An average of a users total ratings will appear in search appended to each user. This is the verification of their knowledge.

## Secondary Functionality: Definitions
1. users can write definitions for IX terminology (similar to blogs?)
2. users can rate the definitions that others submit.
3. The highest rated answer becomes the main answer given in search. 
4. If two definitions have the same score they are presented together. (tie breaker?)

### Tertiary functionality
1. A user can connect their profile to LinkedIn and the application should take the skills listed on their linked in profile and add it to their profile in the app. 

# Slack app and Api functionality
1. A user can type in a slash command in slack followed by a search term and receive back a list of the top rated users who know that subject. 
2. A user can type in a slash command in slack followed by `define` and the search term and receive the top rated definition for the IX word.


The definition thing might actually be the most used feature.
